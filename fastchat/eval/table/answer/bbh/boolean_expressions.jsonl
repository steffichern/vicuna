For example, the following code will result in False:\n```python\na = 10\nb = 10\nprint(a == b)\n```\nIn this case, the values of `a` and `b` are the same, but they are stored in different bytes of memory, so the comparison returns False.\n\nOn the other hand, the comparison with parentheses `( )` is a group operation and it will be evaluated in the order of the group.\n```python\na = 10\nb = 10\nprint((a == b))\n```\nIt will return true\n\nIn this case, the comparison `(a == b)` is evaluated first and returns True.

Each tuple contains a symbol and an optional number of additional symbols, separated by a comma.\n2. Next, we create a set of hash tables to store the states of the machine. The keys of the hash tables are the symbols that appear in the input string, and the values are the corresponding states of the machine.\n3. Then, we use a data structure called a \"trie\" to keep track of the states of the machine. A trie is a tree-like structure where each node represents a symbol and each branch represents a possible extension of that symbol. The leaves of the trie are the states of the machine.\n4. The main loop of the algorithm reads a token from the input string and updates the states of the machine accordingly. If the token reads not, we add it to the set of forbidden tokens.\n5. If the token reads a symbol, we use the trie to determine the next state of the machine. If the symbol is a comma, we look up the next state of the machine in the hash table corresponding to the previous state, which is stored in the trie.\n6. If the symbol is a digit, we use the trie to determine the next state of the machine. If the digit is less than 47, we look up the next state of the machine in the hash table corresponding to the previous state. If the digit is greater than or equal to 48, we look up the next state of the machine in the hash table corresponding to the previous state, but we use the digits as keys instead of symbols.\n7. If the token reads a closing parenthesis, we use the trie to determine the next state of the machine. If the closing parenthesis is preceded by a not token, we add it to the set of forbidden tokens.\n8. If the token reads a closing parenthesis without a not token, we use the trie to determine the next state of the machine. If the closing parenthesis is preceded by a comma, we look up the next state of the machine in the hash table corresponding to the previous state, which is stored in the trie.\n9. If the closing parenthesis is not preceded by a comma, we look up the next state of the machine in the hash table corresponding to the previous state.\n10. We continue this process until we have read all the tokens from the input string.\n11. Finally, we check the states of the machine in the order they were visited and output the set of forbidden tokens if it is not empty, otherwise we output the empty string.\n12.
